My name is Abdullah Rehman and I am reading the Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School. Post my degree, I am looking to pursue my passion for consulting. I was brought up in Pakistan but always had roots in England due to my extensive family here so decided to come here for my undergraduate studies.

I did my undergrad from [**University College London**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) in *Chemical Engineering* and graduated with a first class honors. After my undergrad, I was offered a job at Accenture which I was unable to take at the time due to a few serious family problems back home and I left England for 2 years until now. I am now keen on taking a full time consulting role and looking to do my best to earn a spot in the top tier firms. 

During my spare time, I love to paint. I have an online profile at [Saatchi Art Gallery](https://www.saatchiart.com/account/artworks/1107889). These artworks can be found in the art blogs section of this website. I am also an avid chocolate enthusiast, I can skip any meal of the day except for dessert. 


Below is a list of some of my favourite books. Although I don't get the time to read much these days, these books are still some of my favorites:

* When Breath Becomes Air
     * by Paul Kalanithi
* The Kite Runner
     * by Khaled Hosseini
* Three Cups of Tea
     * by Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin

Thank you for taking the time out to read a bit about me.
