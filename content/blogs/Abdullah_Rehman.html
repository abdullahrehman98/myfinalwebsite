<h2>DATA PROJECT 2</h2>
<p>The first thing to do for this project was to tidy the data, as it was in wide format and we had to make it into long, tidy format alongside making the values more readable since the figures were too big. We are able to view the results as shown below using the glimpse function on our tidy data set.</p>
<pre><code>## Rows: 176,880
## Columns: 5
## $ CountryID     &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,…

## $ value         &lt;dbl&gt; 5.559069, 5.332823, 5.197066, 5.746510, 6.147288, 6.3217…</code></pre>
<p>Next we compared the GDP data of three countries:
* United States
* India
* Germany</p>
<p>The results were plotted using the ggplot function in R with indicator name being used as the color parameter as this allows for easier comparison.</p>

<p>We know that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports).</p>
<p>The next task was to calculate the GDP given the components in the dataframe and compare it with the indicator shown above.</p>
<p>As calculated below, For Germany, the % difference range from 1.0% to 1.04%. The India range from 1.08% to 0.0%. United States range from 1.0% to 1.04%.</p>
<p>We did this by first filtering out exports, imports, household expenditure, government expenditure, gross capital formation. Then we use left join in a number of steps to calculate the net exports and select only the required column. We also convert the type to numeric for the year column as it is a numeric type variable. Now we plot the</p>

<p>What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking at Germany’s GDP breakdown, it’s interesting to note that household expenditures kept a quite steady proportion throughout the whole period, except around the 2008 financial crisis, of which the impact is quite noticeable for all three countries, with Germany’s gross capital formation also having a clear dip around that time. Germany being the only out of the three countries that is part of the European union, it is also interesting to note their exports increasing after the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties were put into place. On a different note, we would also expect the reunification of the west and east Germanies to have a clear impact on the proportion of government expenditure, yet there does not seem to be.</p>
<p>India’s GDP breakdown is quite different from Germany’s. The 2008 financial crisis is quite noticeable as well and seems to particularly have impacted exports, as other countries lost disposable income. It is interesting to note that the government expenditure is around 15% of the GDP throughout the whole period, yet that gross capital formation gains a bigger proportion whilst the proportion of household expenditure keeps on decreasing. We can infer that this is due to a growing population, with increased inequalities; bigger companies and more billionaires, but also more poverty, resulting in less household expenditure.</p>
<p>The United States’ GDP split also showcases the impact of the 2008’s financial crisis, for instance with the Federal Reserve’s help towards the bank creating a small red bump in the late 2000s, early 2010s. Overall, government expenditure’s proportion kept on decreasing as republicans were in office, reducing government spending. It is interesting to note that other major financial crisis did not really impact the way the GDP is split up (2001, 1987).</p>

<h1>Brexit vote analysis</h1>
<p>For one assignment, we were required to recreate the political affiliation
We will have a look at the results of the 2016 Brexit vote in the UK.</p>
<p>The data comes from <a href="https://www.thecrosstab.com/">Elliott Morris</a>, who cleaned it and made it available through his <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r">DataCamp class on analysing election and polling data in R</a>.</p>
<p>The plot below was plotted using the ggplot function and using color to seperate the different parties.</p>
