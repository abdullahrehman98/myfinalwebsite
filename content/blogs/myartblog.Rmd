My love for art stems from growing up in a household where my grandmother was an artist. She is one of my main inspirations for my artworks. 

The artworks below are some of her work:
```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', out.width='50%',out.extra='style="background-color: white;padding:10px"'}
#out.width="70%"
knitr::include_graphics("/img/ART/IMG_5567.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', out.width='50%',out.extra='style="background-color: white;padding:10px"'}
#out.width="70%"
# knitr::include_graphics("/img/ART/IMG_5567.jpg", error = FALSE)

knitr::include_graphics("/img/ART/IMG_5564.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

Growing on this, I started getting into art from a young age. My love for art took me around various art museums as well as weekly visits to the Tate Modern now that I am in London. 

I was able to set up an onlinr profile at [**Saatchi Art Gallery**](https://www.saatchiart.com/account/artworks/1107889). 

You can have a look at my art portfolio through the link above.

My main artworks are oil on canvas some of my favourites which I am attaching below.
