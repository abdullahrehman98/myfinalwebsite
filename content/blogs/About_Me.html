<h2>A bit about me</h2>
<p>My name is Abdullah Rehman as I have mentioned numerous times by now in this report. I am an incoming MAM student looking to pursue my passion for consulting. I was brought up in Pakistan but always had roots in England due to my extensive family here so decided to come her for my undergraduate studies.</p>
<p>I did my undergrad from <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk"><strong>University College London</strong></a> in <em>Chemical Engineering</em> and graduated with a first class honors. After my undergrad, I was offered a job at Accenture which I was unable to take at the time due to a few serious family problems back home and I left England for 2 years until now. I am now keen on taking a full time consulting role and looking to do my best to earn a spot in the top tier firms.</p>
<p>During my spare time, I love to paint. I have an online profile at <a href="https://www.saatchiart.com/account/artworks/1107889">Saatchi Art Gallery</a>. I am attaching a few of them below and the rest can be seen on the link mentioned. I am also an avid chocolate enthusiast, I can skip any meal of the day except for dessert.</p>
