<h2>A bit about me</h2>
<p>My name is Abdullah Rehman as I have mentioned numerous times by now in this report. I am an incoming MAM student looking to pursue my passion for consulting. I was brought up in Pakistan but always had roots in England due to my extensive family here so decided to come her for my undergraduate studies.</p>
<p>I did my undergrad from <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk"><strong>University College London</strong></a> in <em>Chemical Engineering</em> and graduated with a first class honors. After my undergrad, I was offered a job at Accenture which I was unable to take at the time due to a few serious family problems back home and I left England for 2 years until now. I am now keen on taking a full time consulting role and looking to do my best to earn a spot in the top tier firms.</p>
<p>During my spare time, I love to paint. I have an online profile at <a href="https://www.saatchiart.com/account/artworks/1107889">Saatchi Art Gallery</a>. These artworks can be found in the art blogs section of this website. I am also an avid chocolate enthusiast, I can skip any meal of the day except for dessert.</p>
<p>Below is a list of some of my favourite books. Although I donâ€™t get the time to read much these days, these books are still some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>When Breath Becomes Air
<ul>
<li>by Paul Kalanithi</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Kite Runner
<ul>
<li>by Khaled Hosseini</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Three Cups of Tea
<ul>
<li>by Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for taking the time out to read a bit about myself.</p>
